# Changelog

Notable changes to the default templates, newest first. Templates are not
versioned individually; entries are dated by the commit that lands on `main`.

## Unreleased (app instances and extra domains)

### Upgrade notes

- **Nextcloud: admins must be in `users_nextcloud`.** The template now sets
  `auth.keycloak_access_role: true`: Keycloak lets only members of the access
  group (`users_nextcloud`, or `users_<instance-id>`) sign in. A member of
  `admin_nextcloud` who isn't also in `users_nextcloud` was let in before (by
  user_oidc's group whitelist) and is now denied. Before upgrading, add every
  existing Nextcloud admin to `users_nextcloud` (Hub → Users & Groups).
- Paperless-ngx, Vaultwarden and GitLab also set `keycloak_access_role: true`;
  their sign-in already required the access group (login-path gate), so
  nothing changes for their users.
- Vaultwarden runs with `SSO_ONLY`: the email + master password login is off;
  the master password only decrypts the vault after the SSO login.
- Jellyfin: the SSO plugin is pinned (version + sha256) and installed before
  Jellyfin starts; the local `admin` loses its password login (setup moves it
  to the plugin's provider).
- Guacamole: header logins as `guacadmin*` are refused (403); new databases
  name the built-in administrator `guacadmin-<generated suffix>`.
